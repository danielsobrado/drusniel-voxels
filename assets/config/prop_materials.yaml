# Prop Materials Configuration - Medium Detail for RTX 40xx
# Scattered environment props warrant mid-tier treatment
#
# Texture samples per fragment: 9-12 (triplanar × maps)
# Target: ~2,000 props, 1ms frame budget

rocks:
  maps:
    - albedo
    - normal
    - roughness
    - ao
  parallax: 0.0  # Skip - props are smaller, less noticeable
  resolution: 512

furniture:
  maps:
    - albedo
    - normal
    - roughness
  ao: vertex_baked  # Baked in Blender, free at runtime
  resolution: 512

barrels_crates:
  maps:
    - albedo
    - normal
  roughness: 0.8  # Uniform wood roughness - no map needed
  ao: vertex_baked
  resolution: 512

# Performance notes:
# - Props are mid-priority between buildings and terrain
# - Rocks benefit from roughness/AO detail (natural variation)
# - Furniture uses vertex-baked AO (efficient)
# - Barrels/crates are simple enough for uniform roughness
# - No parallax for props - they're viewed at distance
# - 512px resolution sufficient for prop scale
