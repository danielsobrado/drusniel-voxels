# Crop Rendering Configuration - Minimal for RTX 40xx
# Low-poly stylized crops don't benefit from complex PBR
#
# Texture samples per fragment: 1 (albedo only)
# Target: ~10,000 crop instances, 0.5ms frame budget

crops:
  texture_maps:
    - albedo  # GLTF vertex colors handle the rest
  roughness: 0.75  # Uniform - slight sheen on leaves
  metallic: 0.0    # Organic materials, no metal

  # Vertex AO baked in Blender - free at runtime
  use_vertex_ao: true

  # Wind animation more important than texture detail
  wind:
    enabled: true
    strength: 0.15
    frequency: 1.2

# Crop visual priority (in order of importance):
# 1. Wind animation (life) - makes crops feel alive
# 2. Growth stage model swaps (progression) - visual feedback
# 3. LOD system (performance) - many crops on screen
# 4. Texture detail (least important) - stylized aesthetic

# Why minimal textures for crops?
# - Valheim aesthetic uses simple, vibrant colors
# - Wind animation provides most visual interest
# - High instance count (10,000+) requires efficiency
# - GLTF vertex colors sufficient for color variation
# - Players focus on gameplay, not crop texture detail
