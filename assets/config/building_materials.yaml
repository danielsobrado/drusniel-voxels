# Building Materials Configuration - Full PBR for RTX 40xx
# Buildings deserve the most detail - players examine them closely when building
#
# Texture samples per fragment: 15-18 (albedo + normal + roughness + AO, optional parallax)
# Target: ~500 building pieces, 2ms frame budget

texture_format:
  resolution: 1024  # 2K overkill for stylized aesthetic
  maps:
    - albedo
    - normal
    - roughness
    - ao
    # Metallic only for metal materials

materials:
  wood_plank:
    roughness_map: true
    ao_map: true
    parallax: 0.03  # Subtle depth for wood grain
    description: "Weathered wooden planks for walls and floors"

  stone_brick:
    roughness_map: true
    ao_map: true
    parallax: 0.05  # More pronounced for stone crevices
    description: "Rough-hewn stone blocks for foundations and walls"

  metal_plate:
    roughness_map: true
    metallic_map: true  # Only material that needs metallic
    ao_map: true
    parallax: 0.02  # Minimal for smooth metal
    description: "Forged metal plates for reinforcement and decoration"

  thatch:
    roughness_map: true
    ao_map: true
    parallax: 0.04  # Moderate for straw texture
    description: "Bundled straw for roofing"

# Performance notes:
# - Full PBR justified because players stare at buildings up close
# - RTX 40xx handles 15-18 texture samples per fragment trivially
# - Parallax adds depth perception at minimal cost
# - Metal is the only material needing metallic map (most buildings are wood/stone)
