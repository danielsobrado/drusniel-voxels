# Terrain Materials Configuration - Keep Lean for RTX 40xx
# Triplanar triples every texture sample. Keep terrain simple.
#
# Texture samples per fragment: 6 (albedo + normal triplanar)
# Target: ~64 chunks, 1.5ms frame budget

texture_format:
  resolution: 512  # Intentionally low-res (Valheim style)
  maps:
    - albedo
    - normal
    # No roughness maps - uniform values per material
    # No AO maps - SSAO handles ambient occlusion screen-space

materials:
  grass:
    roughness: 0.85  # Uniform value - no texture map
    parallax: 0.0    # Skip parallax for terrain
    description: "Lush meadow grass for temperate biomes"

  dirt:
    roughness: 0.92  # Slightly rougher than grass
    parallax: 0.0
    description: "Exposed soil and tilled earth"

  rock:
    roughness: 0.90
    parallax: 0.04   # Only terrain material with parallax (cliffs)
    description: "Exposed bedrock and cliff faces"

  sand:
    roughness: 0.98  # Very rough, minimal specular
    parallax: 0.0
    description: "Beach and desert sand"

  tilled_soil:
    roughness: 0.92
    parallax: 0.0
    description: "Freshly tilled farming soil"

# Why no terrain AO maps?
# - SSAO handles ambient occlusion screen-space
# - Terrain AO maps look flat/baked compared to dynamic SSAO
# - Saves 3 texture samples per fragment (significant for triplanar)
#
# Why uniform roughness?
# - Natural terrain has fairly consistent roughness per material type
# - Saves 3 texture samples per fragment
# - Visual difference is minimal compared to buildings
