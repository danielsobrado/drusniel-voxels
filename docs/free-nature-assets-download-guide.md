# Free Nature Assets Download Guide

This guide covers the recommended workflow for downloading and organizing free CC0 nature assets.

## Why Auto-Downloads Don't Work

### Poly.pizza (and similar sites)
- No public API for direct downloads
- Requires browser session/cookies
- Anti-bot protection
- Downloads are dynamically generated

### Itch.io (Quaternius, KayKit)
- Pay-what-you-want system (even for free)
- Must click through purchase flow
- Session-based download tokens
- Prevents automated scraping

### Kenney
- Donation flow before download
- Session cookies required
- Can be bypassed but not reliably

## Better Solution: Semi-Automated Workflow

The updated scripts:
- Open download pages in your browser
- Watch your Downloads folder for ZIPs
- Auto-extract and organize when they appear
- Provide copy-paste commands for each step

## Which Script/Guide Should I Use?

### Quick Decision Tree

- Do you want scripts to help at all?
  - NO -> Use `docs/SIMPLE_MANUAL_GUIDE.md`
  - YES -> Continue below

- Are you comfortable with interactive scripts?
  - YES -> Use `scripts/download-nature-assets.ps1` (opens browsers, waits for downloads)
  - NO -> Use `scripts/organize-downloaded-assets.ps1` (just organizes existing files)
